This project is using lightbulb-hikari library. If you are gonna run this, please run bot.py instead of OLD-main.py. 

bot.py is the main one. OLD-main.py is using discord.py 2.0 which I abandoned.

Bot features so far:
    - Truth questions
    - AFK system

Planning to add if I don't get lazy/busy in da future
    - Reaction roles
    - Economy
    - Minigames
    - Music bot (unlikely, but would be interesting)
